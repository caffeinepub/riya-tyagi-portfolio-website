However, the diff also includes unrelated changes (not requested) to URL parameter utilities, project state metadata, and documentation summaries.",

      "description": "Added/expanded URL parameter + sessionStorage utilities (including persisted parameters and hash query parsing/cleanup helpers), which are unrelated to the HeroSection invisible metric/gradient-text fix.",
