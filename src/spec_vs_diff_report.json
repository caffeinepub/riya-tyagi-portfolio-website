  "summary": "Most requested theme refresh is implemented: global beige/off-white + navy tokens, gradient accent utilities, updated navbar styling with smooth scrolling and active-section logic, and modernized card/shadow/rounding across sections. However, the diff introduces additional gradient usage beyond the allowed scope (hero-wide gradient overlays and a general card hover gradient utility) and adds an unrequested footer attribution link.",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Hero uses full-section gradient overlay backgrounds (e.g., bg-gradient-to-b / bg-gradient-to-r) in addition to gradient shapes, which exceeds the constraint that gradients should be only for hero background shapes, CTA buttons, and highlight/stat cards.",
      "reason": "REQ-26 restricts gradient usage; these overlays are gradients used as general hero background layers, not just discrete background shapes.",

    {
      "description": "Introduced a general-purpose card hover gradient effect utility (premium-card-border::before) that applies a linear-gradient background on hover, which can enable gradients on regular cards outside hero/highlight contexts.",
      "reason": "REQ-26 restricts gradients to hero shapes, CTA buttons, and highlight/stat cards; a generic card gradient utility is not requested and risks spreading gradients across the site.",
