  "architectural_notes": [
    "Website should be responsive (desktop/tablet/mobile) and optimized for performance (compressed/optimized images, fast load).",
    "Use SEO-friendly semantic structure (headings/sections/metadata) appropriate for a personal portfolio.",
    "Replace current hero/profile headshot with the user-attached image; crop to a centered head-and-shoulders portrait and optimize for fast loading.",
    "Use the user-provided photo as the hero/profile image (no generated/placeholder/non-real headshot). Keep the photo as-is (no stylized replacement).",
    "Use the user-attached template as the primary visual/layout reference to enhance the site’s design (reduce simplicity; add richer sections, styling, and interactions consistent with the template while keeping a clean professional portfolio).",
    "Ensure the downloadable resume asset is a valid, non-corrupted PDF and is served correctly so the downloaded file opens in standard PDF viewers.",
    "Homepage redesign: keep current layout/sections/spacing (hero text-left, profile image-right) but update theme to soft off-white/light beige background with deep navy/dark blue headings/body text.",
    "Use one vibrant gradient accent style (either Purple→Pink→Orange or Blue→Cyan→Teal) and restrict gradients to hero background shapes, CTA buttons, and highlight/stat cards only; keep overall look professional and recruiter-friendly.",
    "Homepage UI styling preference: minimal modern UI with smooth gradients, soft shadows, rounded cards; colorful but not childish.",
    "Contact form: enable backend storage of submissions (name, email, message, timestamp) so messages are not lost even without email notifications."

  "known_issues": [
    "Hero/profile image is being replaced with a non-real/incorrect picture instead of the user-provided photo; must display the provided photo as-is.",
    "Downloaded Resume file errors on open (likely corrupted/incorrect PDF asset or serving issue); replace with the user-provided working PDF and verify download opens correctly.",
    "Contact form does not send email notifications; implement backend storage as the supported alternative (and clarify no email alerts).",
    "No Internet Identity login button is currently visible in the navigation, preventing admin authentication and causing 'Unauthorized access' on /messages.",
    "Contact form/message submission is again failing with error \"failed to save messages\" (regression persists after Version 10 deployment).",
    "Admin secret token is not configured, so /messages shows 'Unauthorized access'/'Get admin access' even after successful Internet Identity login.",
    "/messages page shows \"Failed to load messages. Please try again later.\" even after Internet Identity login + admin token; indicates backend `getAllMessages()`/message listing call is failing.",
    "/messages page stuck in infinite admin-access loop: user is logged in with Internet Identity but UI keeps requesting ?caffeineAdminToken=YOUR_TOKEN; expected auto-insert admin token link/button is missing.",

    "/messages still shows 'Admin Access Issue / Unauthorized Access' even when logged in with Internet Identity and admin token shows configured; re-provisioning does not resolve, indicating backend admin provisioning/binding to principal is incomplete or broken."
