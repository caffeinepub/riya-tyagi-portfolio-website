# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Refresh the portfolio homepage with a modern beige + navy theme and a consistent Blue→Cyan→Teal gradient accent, while keeping the existing layout/sections unchanged and updating the hero copy.

**Planned changes:**
- Update global colors to a soft off-white/light beige background with deep navy/dark blue headings and primary text, without changing section order, spacing, or hero composition (text left, image right).
- Apply a single Blue→Cyan→Teal gradient accent only to hero background shapes, CTA buttons, and highlight/stat cards; remove/avoid gradients elsewhere.
- Update Hero content to: Name “Riya Tyagi”, Title “Data Analytics & Data Science Professional”, and add tagline “Turning data into actionable insights”, keeping CTA labels as “View Portfolio”, “Download Resume”, “Contact Me”.
- Refresh component styling to be minimal and recruiter-friendly (rounded cards, soft shadows, polished hover/focus), while staying professional and not overly playful.
- Keep existing navigation behavior (active section highlighting, smooth scrolling) and update navbar styling to match the new theme without breaking responsiveness.

**User-visible outcome:** The homepage retains the same structure and interactions but appears in a beige + navy modern theme with restrained gradient accents, and the hero section shows the updated name/title/tagline with the same CTA buttons.
